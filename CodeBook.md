The original data was obtained from here:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

More information relating to the data can be found there.

Transformations specifically made for this project were as follows:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
